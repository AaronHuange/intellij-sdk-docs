title: Custom UI Themes
---

Beginning with the 2019.1 release, custom UI Themes are supported by IntelliJ IDEA.
Custom UI Themes give designers control of the appearance of built-in IntelliJ IDEA UI elements.
The [UI Themes available for download](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?headline=164-theme&tags=Theme) illustrate the creative possibilities.
 
[Creating a new UI element](/user_interface_components/user_interface_components.md) for a plugin is distinctly different than Custom UI Themes. 

> **note** Custom UI Themes are available beginning in version **2019.1**.

This section discusses creating and customizing UI Themes:
* [Creating UI Themes](themes.md)
* [Customizing UI Themes](themes_customize.md)
* [Adding Editor Schemes and Background Images](themes_extras.md)

For plugin developers, [Exposing Theme Metadata](themes_metadata.md) discusses the format of customization keys and information how to provide it to Theme authors.
